# Template Repository for Research Projects
A template repository for research project. The repository contains:
- code: There are times that you are working on a code which you are not going to use it as part of your paper submission. This can be a project to get familiar with the data, or a toy examlpe on a specific type of network. The code for each of these projects will be a subdirectory of the code directory
- literature_review: The tex files and resources for each literature review would be a subdirectory of literature_review
- meetings: Contains two subdirectories one for meetings with your committee members and one for meetings with your supervisor which are used to store files related to each meeting
- proposals: Each proposal you work on, for example, Ph.D. proposal and grant proposal, is a subdirectory of proposals
- submissions: All tex files and code files for submitted articles/posters will be a subdirectory of submissions

Ignore files from being pushed to GitHub using a .gitignore file and always ignore files in the data directory to be commited to git. The sample .gitignore files are good starting points.

__Note__: When using virtual environments, always ignore them from being pushed to GitHub. Also, ignore your dataset from being pushed to git.
