# Template Repository for Research Projects
A template repository for research project. The repository contains:
- code: The code for each project you do is a subdirectory of the code
- literature_review: The tex files and resources for each literature review would be a subdirectory of literature_review
- proposals: Each proposal you work on, for example, Ph.D. proposal and grant proposal, is a subdirectory of proposals
- submissions: All tex files and code files for submitted articles/posters will be a subdirectory of submissions

Ignore files from being pushed to GitHub using a .gitignore file and always ignore files in the data directory to be commited to git. The sample .gitignore files are good starting points.
